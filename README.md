# WebSocketsClientServerDemo

1. Install an Application Server, like Tomcat or GlassFish. I installed GlassFish 4 (https://glassfish.java.net/download.html).

2. Using Eclipse Marketplace install GlassFish Tools for [Luna] your version of Eclipse. After that, you will be able to create Java Web projects, as well as start Application Server from inside the Eclipse.
